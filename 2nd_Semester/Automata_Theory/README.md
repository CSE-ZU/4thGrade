# Automata Theory
## Introduction
Finite automata are a useful model for many important kinds of hardware and software.
1. Software for designing and checking the behavior of digital circuits.
2. The \"lexical analyzer" of a typical compiler, that is, the compiler component that breaks the input text into logical units, such as identifiers, keywords, and punctuation.
3. Software for scanning large bodies of text, such as collections of Web pages, to nd occurrences of words, phrases, or other patterns.
4. Software for verifying systems of all types that have a finite number of distinct states, such as communications protocols or protocols for secure exchange of information.
